# time_clock_pro_addon
an addon for the WP Plugin, Time Clock Pro, to be able to see who is currently on site, who last logged out and who has forgotton to log out

We bought the Time Clock Pro plugin here https://wpplugin.org/downloads/time-clock-pro/

Unfortunately it doesn't have the functionality to see who is currenlty logged in, who last logged out or who has forgotten to log out.

I asked the developer if they could add or enable this functionality but they recommeneded developing it ourselves, which we have done. Delighted if they choose to integrate this back into their code, I just hacked it together with the help of Chat GPT so I'm sure it could be more configurable etc. 

Please feel free to do what you like with it but clearly at your own risk etc etc


==================

Hi Robin,

There is not currently a built-in feature to show which users are currently clocked in. It would be fairly simple for a developer to build that for you, but it's not a feature we currently offer.

Thanks,
